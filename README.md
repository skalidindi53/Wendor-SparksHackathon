## Future Updates
Wendor aims to be a community-driven platform, and we have a roadmap full of exciting enhancements that reflect this philosophy. Here's what you can look forward to in the future:

- **User-Contributed Locations**: We plan to empower users to add additional vending machines and water fountains to the map. This will create a comprehensive and community-curated database, ensuring that everyone can find what they need on campus.
- **Reviews and Ratings**: In a later update, users will be able to add reviews and ratings to the vending machines and water fountains. These collaborative responses will foster community engagement and provide valuable insights.
- **Community-Led Maintenance**: By gathering reviews and ratings, Wendor will help the community distinguish which vending machines require repairing and upgrades. This feature exemplifies our core belief: this service is done by the community, for the community.
